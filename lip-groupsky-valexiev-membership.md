## Procedures

### 1. Admission of Members

Any entity - legal or virtual - has the right to request to become a member. The request should be accompanied with a short introduction preferably in written form that has at least:

1. Contact email
1. Who is the entity
2. Why does it want to become a member
3. What benefits to the community will be provided
 
Any other information is welcomed but not required.

After receiving the request a public discussion should be initiated which should ultimately result in a voting that will decide the result of the request. For a member request to be approved the votes in favor must be greater than the votes against.

After the vote have decided upon the requested memberhip, an e-mail is sent to the requesting entity to notify of the outcome and any next steps if necessary.

Eventhough the majority of the community will ultimately decide who will be a member, a short list of favorabble and unfavorable features is provided for a guideline here:
